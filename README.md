# One Step One Agent

A real-time AI-powered sales assistant designed to improve customer experience and conversion rates at **Kavak**.  
This system listens to the customer's voice, gathers personal preferences, and provides tailored car recommendations through a live conversational interface powered by the **OpenAI Realtime API**.

---

## Problem Description

Traditional car sales interactions are often slow and depend heavily on manual processes.  
Customers frequently abandon conversations when they canâ€™t receive fast and personalized attention.

**Kavak Sales Copilot** solves this by introducing an **autonomous voice-driven agent** capable of:
- Listening and speaking in real time.  
- Collecting customer data and preferences.  
- Recommending cars based on budget, age, and needs.  
- Storing customer feedback for continuous improvement.
