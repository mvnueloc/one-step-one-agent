A real-time AI-powered sales assistant designed to improve customer experience and conversion rates at **Kavak**.  
This system listens to the customer's voice, gathers personal preferences, and provides tailored car recommendations through a live conversational interface powered by the **OpenAI Realtime API**.

## Problem Description

Traditional car sales interactions are often slow and depend heavily on manual processes.  
Customers frequently abandon conversations when they canâ€™t receive fast and personalized attention.

**Kavak Sales Copilot** solves this by introducing an **autonomous voice-driven agent** capable of:
- Listening and speaking in real time.  
- Collecting customer data and preferences.  
- Recommending cars based on budget, age, and needs.  
- Storing customer feedback for continuous improvement.

```

## Key Components

- **Main Agent (Andres)**: Core conversation manager that interacts with the customer.
- **Car Recommendator Agent**: Specialized sub-agent that retrieves data from the internal catalog (cars_db).

## Tools:

- setPersonalData: Stores user data (name, age, budget, capacity, and car type).
- saveUserFeedback: Records the customer's evaluation and feedback.
- getCarCatalog: Retrieves car data from a predefined dataset.
-- scheduleAppointment: (optional) Books a follow-up meeting.


## Metrics
We use metrics like cosine similarity to evaluate each embedding. If a high similarity is detected, the system goes straight to the recommendation without asking redundant questions, allowing for faster, hyper-personalized suggestions that feel intuitive and context-aware, improving customer satisfaction and conversion rates.
